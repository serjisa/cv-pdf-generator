    about me:
    - I'm doing a PhD in neuroscience at Igor Adameyko's lab at the Medical University
      of Vienna. Mostly I'm focused on developing approaches for the analysis and
      interpretation of multimodal single-cell omics and lineage tracing experiments.
      Previously worked (and still am interested) in cancer immunology and evolutionary
      zoology.
