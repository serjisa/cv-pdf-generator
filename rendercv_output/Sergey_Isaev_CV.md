# About Me

I'm doing a PhD in neuroscience at Igor Adameyko's lab at the Medical University of Vienna. Mostly I'm focused on developing approaches for the analysis and interpretation of multimodal single-cell omics and lineage tracing experiments. Previously worked (and still am interested) in cancer immunology and evolutionary zoology.
